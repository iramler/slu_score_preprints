description: Learn about and compare two models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest), that will predict NBA players to make the all-NBA first team in a given season.

## Module

### Introduction

This qmd file explores using statistical modeling techniques to predict which NBA players are most likely to be selected to the all-NBA first Team in a given season. Using player statistics from 1980 to 2024, we will apply two models --- logistic regression and random forest classification --- to estimate the likelihood of each player's selection. Logistic regression learns for binary outcomes and the models are more simple. Random forests on the other hand, are powerful ensemble models that improve prediction accuracy by combining the results of many decision trees. We'll walk through each step of the modeling process, from data preparation and model training to evaluation and interpretation.

The learning objectives associated with this module are:

-   Understand the difference between logistic regression and random forest models.

-   Fit and interpret a logistic regression model 

-   Train and evaluate a random forest model

-   Interpret a correlation matrix

-   Evaluate model performance

-   Compare model accuracy and prediction behavior
