## Module

Please note that these material have not yet completed the required pedagogical and industry peer-reviews to become a published module on the SCORE Network. However, instructors are still welcome to use these materials if they are so inclined.

### Introduction

Data for a particular sport is often stored across numerous locations. For example, in NCAA Division I Softball, batting statistics for each season are typically stored in separate tables. (See for example the statistics hosted by [https://d1softball.com/](https://d1softball.com/){target="_blank"}.)

Suppose we are interested in tracking the statistics of players across multiple seasons. A common way to prep the data to do this is to use join statements to merge each seasons data into one table with one row per player (and columns associated with their different statistics for each season).

This module looks at some simple batting stats over two seasons through the use of joining functions for a small subset of NCAA Division 1 Softball players' statistics for the 2021 and 2022 seasons. (This is only a small window of a much bigger dataset).

Upon completion of this module students should improve upon
* being able to join two data tables
* being able to anticipate (by sketching) the resulting data table prior to running the code to do so
* identify situations where more than one key is needed

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Methods" appearance="minimal"}
For `R` users, recall that six commonly used joining functions available through the [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/two-table.html/){target="_blank"} package are, `left`, `right`, `full`, `inner`, `semi`, and `anti`. Additionally, other useful dplyr verbs for combining multiple tables of data include `intersect`, `union`, and `setdiff`. (These are called [set operators](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/two-table.html#set-operations){target="_blank"}. )

Further details regarding joins can be found at [https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/two-table.html](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/two-table.html){target="_blank"}.

Technology requirement: The activity handout has optional components for students that can use technology to perform the joins. However, it is not a requirement to complete the main exercises. It is assumed that students will use `R` for the module, but a pair of databases (one in sqlite, the other in duckdb) are provided for students that prefer to use `SQL`.

### Data

There are four data tables associated with this module.

Two of them, `batting2021` and `batting2022`, contain statistics for all Division 1 Softball player who played in the 2021 and/or 2022 season. 

The other two, `batting2021_subset` and `batting2022_subset`, represent non-random samples taken the full data. These are displayed below. R is the number of runs scored by the player, H is the number of hits.

<details>
<summary><b>Additional details for the full data (batting2021 and batting2022)</b></summary>

The 2021 data set has 2131 rows with 22 columns. The 2022 data set has 2275 rows with the same 22 columns. Each row represents a Division 1 Softball player who played in the
2021 and/or 2022 season. 

| Variable | Description |
|----|-------------|
| Player | Name of the softball player |
| Team | Name of the team (school) for each player |
| BA           | Batting Average - The ratio of a player's total base hits to their total number of at-bats, indicating their ability to make successful hits. |

By working through the different scenarios, students will become aware of how the choice of join changes the meaning of the resulting table. Additionally, when working with large datasets, students should recognize that care must be taken when choosing their keys as duplicates may not be easy to see in a snippet of the data.
