## Module

Please note that these material have not yet completed the required pedagogical and industry peer-reviews to become a published module on the SCORE Network. However, instructors are still welcome to use these materials if they are so inclined.

### Introduction

The International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS), organizes and records a series of events such as the World Cup which exists for all disciplines of FIS such as Nordic Skiing. World Cup races occur every weekend between January and March, with events hosted in different countries. These events consist of multiple different races, held in different disciplines and distances. Nordic skiing is split up into two different techniques, classic and skate, all race weekends have a mixture of skate and classic technique races. The race in this dataset is a womens' 10k classic race set in Trondheim, Norway. In long distance pieces like 10ks there is often a lot of discussion about pacing. Racers' times are recorded at different distance intervals throughout the course. It is interesting to look at how well racers' times at different distances predict their rank at the end of the race. For example, do the racers who have top times at an early distance have good ranks at the end of the race?

By the end of this activity, you will be able to:

1.  Fit a linear regression model.

2.  Assess a correlation.

3.  Look at and ANOVA model for a randomized block design

### Data

Each row of the dataset represents a skier in the womens' 10k classic
ski race in Trondheim. There are 61 racers in the dataset and 24 variables.
The "splits" record rank, time, and sped at four points in the race 1=1.3 km, 2=4.3 km, 3=7.5 km, and 4=10 km (finish).
