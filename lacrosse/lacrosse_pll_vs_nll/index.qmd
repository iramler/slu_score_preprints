## Module

Please note that these material have not yet completed the required pedagogical and industry peer-reviews to become a published module on the SCORE Network. However, instructors are still welcome to use these materials if they are so inclined.

### Introduction

This module examines the goals and shots in two prominent lacrosse
leagues: the Premier Lacrosse League (PLL) and the National Lacrosse
League (NLL). The PLL and NLL are highly regarded professional lacrosse
leagues that feature top-tier athletes from around the world. The PLL is
played in an outdoor, smaller field while the NLL plays on an indoor
field with traditional dimensions. This data set allows for an analysis
of goal-scoring within these leagues to look for differences between
indoor and outdoor play

The learning goals associated with this module are:

*    Students will be able to test for a difference in means between two groups.
*    Students will be able to find a confidence interval for a difference in means between two groups.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Methods" appearance="minimal"}
This module requires students use a two-sample test and confidence interval (e.g., t-test or randomization) to compare the means of two groups.

Technology requirement: The activity handout assume that students can use technology to perform a two-sample test and find a confidence interval for a difference in means between two groups, using raw data from the datafile.

### Data

The data set has 162 rows with 9 columns. Each row represents a single lacrosse match either in the Premier Lacrosse League or the National Lacrosse League.
