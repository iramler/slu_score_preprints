### Introduction

In this engaging activity, we delve into the exciting world of NCAA Division I Lacrosse faceoff percentages. Our primary goal is to compare a specific team's performance with overall league statistics for the 2022-2023 season. Throughout this exploration, we will focus on the concept of one sample proportion hypothesis testing, a powerful statistical tool commonly used in sports analytics. By the end of this exercise, you will gain a fundamental understanding of hypothesis testing and its practical applications in evaluating team performance.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Conclusion"}
In this insightful exploration of NCAA Division I Lacrosse faceoff percentages, we have embarked on a statistical journey to evaluate a specific team's performance in comparison to league-wide statistics. Through the application of one sample proportion hypothesis testing, we gained valuable insights into the team's faceoff win percentage, unveiling strong evidence that their performance exceeded what we would expect by random chance alone. As we consider the broader implications of faceoffs in Division I Lacrosse, it becomes evident that faceoff wins play a pivotal role in team rankings and outcomes. The fact that Duke, the second-best team in the country, exhibited a faceoff win percentage above the league average highlights the significance of excelling in this aspect of the game. Winning faceoffs likely translates to higher goal-scoring opportunities, ultimately leading to more successful game outcomes.
