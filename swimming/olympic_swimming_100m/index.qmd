## Introduction

For this activity, you will be exploring the event times for female swimmers that competed in the 100m event from 1924 to 2020 in the [Olympics](https://olympics.com/en/paris-2024/sports/swimming){target="_blank"}.

In particular, you will examine visualizations and conduct confidence intervals to explore the changes in finish times between different types of strokes and earlier vs. recent years.

Investigating this data is useful for several reasons. Exploring this data can deepen our understanding of how swimming techniques and training have improved over the years and which strokes will be the fastest in this event. Also, analyzing how times have improved over the years gives insights into how competitive the event has gotten in recent years. It can show the subtle time differentials between the top and average athletes. Analysis like this can help inform the impact of modern training strategies, inspire athletes to practice different strokes, and help aspiring Olympic swimmers understand what times they need to be competitive.

The provided worksheets require StatKey or similar software to get the z-score. They will also require access to a calculator.

Since the data are provided, instructors are encouraged to modify the worksheets to have student's to make calculations and models on their preferred software.

## Data

The data set contains 606 rows and 10 columns. Each row represents a swimmer who competed in the 100m Olympic event during the period 1924 to 2020. The data includes top 8 finishers from men and woman racers however, due to lack of records, some of the data is excluded.
