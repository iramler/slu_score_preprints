## Motivation

Golf is a sport where you hit a ball into a series of holes with as few strokes as possible. The two most important strokes are the drive and the putt. The drive is the first stroke used to hit the ball as far as possible from the tee box towards the hole, while the putt is the final stroke used to roll the ball into the hole on the green.
