## Module

Please note that these material have not yet completed the required pedagogical and industry peer-reviews to become a published module on the SCORE Network. However, instructors are still welcome to use these materials if they are so inclined.

### Introduction

For this activity, you will be exploring data from the 2023 Boston Marathon by analyzing the result times of the finishing runners. Focusing on the single quantitative variable of result times in minutes, you will examine both visualizations and summary statistics to make key conclusions. The incorporation of z-scores will allow for comparisons to be made between two subsets of the data by determining performances of top finishers.

By the end of the activity, you will be able to:

1.  Analyze structures and distributions of histograms
2.  Use basic summary statistics to assess center and spread
3.  Calculate further relevant metrics for quantitative data
4.  Calculate and compare z-scores for individual cases

In conclusion, the Boston Marathon Times worksheet provides valuable learning opportunities for students in several key areas. Firstly, it introduces them to the calculation of essential summary statistics, allowing them to gain a deeper understanding of the distribution of result times. Secondly, by identifying outliers above or below the upper fences, students can recognize and analyze exceptional performances in the marathon. Lastly, the calculation of z-scores enables students to compare and contrast the remarkable achievements of the top female and male finishers, shedding light on their talent in their respective fields. Overall, this worksheet allows students to critically analyze the 2023 marathon result data and draw meaningful conclusions about the extraordinary performances of athletes in the race.
