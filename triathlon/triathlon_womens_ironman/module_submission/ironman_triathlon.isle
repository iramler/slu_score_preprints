The dataset <a href="https://github.com/iramler/slu_score/blob/main/triathlon_womens_ironman/data/Ironman1819.csv" target="_blank">`ironman1819.csv`</a> contains data on female finishers of the [Lake Placid Ironman Triathlon](https://www.ironman.com/im-lake-placid) from 2002 to 2021. The motivation for this data analysis is to explore the relationships between `swim times`, `bike times`, and `run times` (in minutes) in order to gain insights into the performance patterns of the athletes. By analyzing these relationships, we can understand the interplay between different segments of the race and potentially identify areas of improvement for athletes.  For this activity, we will specifically focus on times from finishers in the years 2018 and 2019.

The data set has 1105 rows with 17 columns. Each row represents a female who has  participated in the Ironman between the years 2018-2019.

The learning goals associated with this module are:

* Students will be able to generate a scatterplot for two quantitative variables
* Students will be able to estimate the correlation from a scatterplot with a linear association and calculate it using technology
* Students will gain experience linking a casual mechanism to an observed correlation
</div>


<div>
This module requires students to construct **scatterplots** and calculate **correlations**.

Technology requirement: Any software capable of creating plots and calculating correlations.
