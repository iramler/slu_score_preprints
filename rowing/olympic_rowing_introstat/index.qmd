### Introduction

This activity looks at the total number of medals and points for nations in [Olympic rowing between 1900 and 2022](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results?resource=download){target="_blank"}.

The Summer Olympic Games are an international athletics event held every four years and hosted in different countries around the world. Rowing was added to the Olympics in 1896 and has been in every Summer Olympics since. Rowing races in the Olympic context are typically regatta style, meaning that there are multiple boats racing head-to-head against each other in multiple lanes. Since 1912, the standard distance for Olympic regattas has been 2000m. The boat that is first to cross the finish line is awarded a gold medal, the second a silver medal, and the third a bronze. Over the course of its time as an Olympic sport there have been 25 different event entries.

In this dataset, the medals are counted as one medal towards each boat as opposed to each athlete in the boat. In looking at the total medals and total points for each nation, it is interesting to see which nations dominate in Olympic rowing. Additionally, looking at the overall distribution of the medals for all countries provides insight on just how lob-sided medaling can be in rowing at the Olympic level.

By the end of the activity, students will be able to:

1.  Assess and interpret data distribution using histograms
2.  Obtain summary statistics with with statistical software
3.  Identify outliers with IQR

### Data

In the data set there are 41 medalling nations that competed in 25 different events. Each row represents a nation and their `medals` and `points` which are cumulative from all rowing Olympics between 1900 and 2022. In total, there are 41 rows with 3 variables. In the original dataset, there were 101 nations in rowing, but the data has been adjusted to include only nations that medalled.

| `NOC`    | National Olympic Committee or the nation competing.                                                                                                           |

| `points` | The total number of points for that country in that event. The points are scaled with a gold medal counting for 3 points, a silver for 2, and a bronze for 1. |
| `gold`   | The total number of gold medals for that country.                                                                                                             |
| `silver` | The total number of silver medals for that country.                                                                                                           |

This Olympic rowing medals worksheet builds students' understanding of data distribution through histograms, summary statistics, and outliers. It also strengthens students' ability to critically evaluate confounding variables and devising relationships amongst variables through looking at barplots. Additionally, it provides an interesting opportunity for students to look at patterns in medals for Olympic rowing.
