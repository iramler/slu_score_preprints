However, instructors are still welcome to use these materials if they are so inclined.\n\n\nIn NASCAR, driver rating is a metric used to evaluate the performance of drivers in races. It provides a comprehensive assessment of a driver’s overall competitiveness, efficiency, and consistency during a race. The driver rating is based on several key performance factors and is designed to offer a more objective view of a driver’s abilities. For this activity, you will be exploring the relationship between average position a driver finishes per lap over a season and their corresponding driver rating. Using data transformations techniques and polynomial regression to create different variations of linear models, you will enhance the capabilities of your models to make them more effective and accurate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of the activity, you will have practiced:\n\nAssessing simple linear regression model effectiveness\nChecking regression model assumptions\nUsing log transformations to better fit a linear regression model\nUsing polynomial regression to fit a curved relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this activity, students will need to use software to create scatterplots and plots of residual vs fitted values of models they will create. They will also need to create polynomial models and mutate the data by applying mathematic functions to columns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data comes from the NASCAR website and shows the season statistics from 2007-2022. Each row displays the metrics of a racer for that specific year.

Through the transformation of the average position variable, the worksheet enables students to enhance linearity in their models, thereby improving the accuracy of their predictions and analysis. The identification of curvature in the variable relationship also allows for the model using quadratic regression to be highly effective.

However, instructors are still welcome to use these materials if they are so inclined.\n\n\nIn NASCAR, driver rating is a metric used to evaluate the performance of drivers in races. It provides a comprehensive assessment of a driver’s overall competitiveness, efficiency, and consistency during a race. The driver rating is based on several key performance factors and is designed to offer a more objective view of a driver’s abilities. For this activity, you will be exploring the relationship between average position a driver finishes per lap over a season and their corresponding driver rating. Using data transformations techniques and polynomial regression to create different variations of linear models, you will enhance the capabilities of your models to make them more effective and accurate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of the activity, you will have practiced:\n\nAssessing simple linear regression model effectiveness\nChecking regression model assumptions\nUsing log transformations to better fit a linear regression model\nUsing polynomial regression to fit a curved relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this activity, students will need to use software to create scatterplots and plots of residual vs fitted values of models they will create. They will also need to create polynomial models and mutate the data by applying mathematic functions to columns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data comes from the NASCAR website and shows the season statistics from 2007-2022. Each row displays the metrics of a racer for that specific year. The data frame contains 1111 rows of observations and 20 variables.\nDownload data: nascar_driver_statistics.csv\n\n\nVariable Descriptions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nWins\nThe sum of the driver’s victories\n\n\nAvgStart\nThe sum of the driver’s starting positions divided by the number of races\n\n\nAvgMidRace\nThe sum of the driver’s mid race positions divided by the number of races\n\n\nAvgFinish\nThe sum of the driver’s finishing positions divided by the number of races\n\n\nAvgPos\nThe sum of the driver’s position each lap divided by the number of laps\n\n\nPassDiff\nThe sum of green flag passes minus green times passed\n\n\nGreenFlagPasses\nNumber of green flag passes performed by the driver\n\n\nGreenFlagPassed\nNumber of times driver is passed during green flag\n\n\nQualityPasses\nNumber of passes in the top 15 while under green flag conditions by driver\n\n\nPercentQualityPasses\nThe sum of quality passes divided by green flag passes\n\n\nNumFastestLaps\nNumber of where the driver had the fastest speed on the lap\n\n\nLapsInTop15\nNumber of laps completed while running in a top 15 position\n\n\nPercentLapsInTop15\nThe sum of the laps run in the top 15 divided by total laps completed\n\n\nLapsLed\nThe sum of the laps led in a race\n\n\nPercentLapsLed\nThe sum of the laps led in the race\n\n\nTotalLaps\nThe sum of the laps completed by a driver that year\n\n\nDriverRating\nFormula combining wins, finish, top15-finish, average running position while on lead lap, average speed under green, fastest lap, led most laps, and lead lap finish with a maximum rating of 150 points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass handout\nClass handout - with solutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, the Transforming NASCAR Driver Data worksheet offers valuable insights into the relationship between average position and driver rating in NASCAR. Through the transformation of the average position variable, the worksheet enables students to enhance linearity in their models, thereby improving the accuracy of their predictions and analysis. The identification of curvature in the variable relationship also allows for the model using quadratic regression to be highly effective. The model can be conceptually compared to the model using a square root transformation to capture the same curve. Assessing the effectiveness of each model, students can critically evaluate the different approaches and determine the most suitable model for the data. This exercise equips students with essential data transformation and modeling skills, empowering them to make informed decisions and gain a deeper understanding of the factors influencing a driver’s performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFill in later"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Please note that these material have not yet completed the required pedagogical and industry peer-reviews to become a published module on the SCORE Network. However, instructors are still welcome to use these materials if they are so inclined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeague of Legends (LoL) is a 5 v. 5 multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed by Riot Games. In this game, players assume the role of a “champion” with unique abilities and engage in intense battles against a team of other players or computer-controlled champions. Riot Games continually collects data to evaluate the impact of each champion, adjusting and fine-tuning various aspects to ensure fair and competitive gameplay. With regular updates (patches) occurring every two weeks, champions can become either extremely efficient and strong or in need of adjustments to enhance their abilities. Maintaining overall game balance is crucial, and developers employ strategies known as “nerfing” and “buffing” to achieve this balance. “Nerfing” refers to reducing the power or effectiveness of a champion or item, while “buffing” involves increasing its power or effectiveness.\nIn this worksheet, we will analyze and describe histograms of Win Rates for different champions in LoL. The Win Rate, a key metric in the game, represents the percentage of games won by a champion out of the total games played. Understanding the distribution of Win Rates and identifying potential outliers can provide valuable insights into champion balance and performance, informing strategic decision-making in LoL gameplay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of this activity, you will be able to:\n\nUnderstand the concept of histograms and their relevance in statistical analysis.\nAnalyze and describe histograms to gain insights into the distribution of Win Rates in League of Legends.

However, instructors are still welcome to use these materials if they are so inclined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeague of Legends (LoL) is a 5 v. 5 multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed by Riot Games. In this game, players assume the role of a “champion” with unique abilities and engage in intense battles against a team of other players or computer-controlled champions. Riot Games continually collects data to evaluate the impact of each champion, adjusting and fine-tuning various aspects to ensure fair and competitive gameplay. With regular updates (patches) occurring every two weeks, champions can become either extremely efficient and strong or in need of adjustments to enhance their abilities. Maintaining overall game balance is crucial, and developers employ strategies known as “nerfing” and “buffing” to achieve this balance. “Nerfing” refers to reducing the power or effectiveness of a champion or item, while “buffing” involves increasing its power or effectiveness.\nIn this worksheet, we will analyze and describe histograms of Win Rates for different champions in LoL. The Win Rate, a key metric in the game, represents the percentage of games won by a champion out of the total games played. Understanding the distribution of Win Rates and identifying potential outliers can provide valuable insights into champion balance and performance, informing strategic decision-making in LoL gameplay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of this activity, you will be able to:\n\nUnderstand the concept of histograms and their relevance in statistical analysis.\nAnalyze and describe histograms to gain insights into the distribution of Win Rates in League of Legends.

Initially, both Swim Time and Bike Time demonstrated significance as individual predictors, supported by hypothesis tests and confidence intervals. The hypothesis test for the slope term of Bike Time yielded a p-value of 0, indicating its significance.

However, instructors are still welcome to use these materials if they are so inclined.\n\n\nThe Triathlon Multiple Linear Regression worksheet focuses on analyzing the relationships and predictive capabilities of multiple variables in the context of triathlon performance. Specifically, we will explore the prediction of run times using swim times and bike times as predictors. By employing simple regression models, checking conditions with Residuals vs. Fits plots, and conducting hypothesis tests and confidence intervals, we aim to identify significant predictors and understand their contextual implications. The dataset used for this analysis comprises the 2022 Canadian finishers of the Lake Placid Ironman.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstand the concept of multiple linear regression and its application in analyzing sports data.\nRecognize the importance of checking assumptions, such as assessing residuals vs. fits plots, for validating the regression models.\nGain insights into the significance of predictors through hypothesis tests and confidence intervals.\nComprehend the interpretation and contextual implications of the findings from multiple linear regression analyses in the triathlon setting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n\n\n\n\n\nTo successfully complete this worksheet, students should have prior knowledge of the following statistical concepts:\n\nFamiliarity with simple linear regression, including interpretation of slopes, intercepts, and residuals.\nUnderstanding of hypothesis testing and confidence intervals, particularly in the context of regression analysis.\nKnowledge of residual analysis, including the interpretation of residual plots.\nBasic understanding of the triathlon sport and its components (swimming, biking, and running) to better grasp the contextual implications of the statistical analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data set has 64 rows with 17 columns.

Initially, both Swim Time and Bike Time demonstrated significance as individual predictors, supported by hypothesis tests and confidence intervals. The hypothesis test for the slope term of Bike Time yielded a p-value of 0, indicating its significance. Additionally, the 95% confidence interval for the slope term of Swim Time excluded 0, further affirming its significance.\nHowever, when both Swim Times and Bike Times were included as predictors in the multiple linear regression model, we observed a change in significance. Swim Times were no longer a significant predictor. This finding suggests that when considering both predictors simultaneously, the predictive power of Swim Times in estimating run times diminishes. These findings emphasize the importance of evaluating multiple predictors in regression analysis and understanding how their inclusion can impact the significance and interpretation of individual predictors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFill in later"
