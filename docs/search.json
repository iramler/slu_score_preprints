For example, in NCAA Division I Softball, batting statistics for each season are typically stored in separate tables. (See for example the statistics hosted by https://d1softball.com/.)\nSuppose we are interested in tracking the statistics of players across multiple seasons. A common way to prep the data to do this is to use join statements to merge each seasons data into one table with one row per player (and columns associated with their different statistics for each season).\nThis module looks at some simple batting stats over two seasons through the use of joining functions for a small subset of NCAA Division 1 Softball players’ statistics for the 2021 and 2022 seasons.

    "text": "The Boston Marathon is an annual marathon traditionally held on Patriots’ Day, the third Monday of April. Begun in 1897, the event is one of the world’s oldest annual marathons and ranks as one of the world’s most prestigious road racing events. The Boston Marathon attracts runners from all over the world, featuring thousands of participants and extensive spectator support, embodying the spirit of community and endurance.\nWe will be investigating the results from the 2023 Boston Marathon - which consists of 26,598 runners that completed the race. In addition to the name, gender, and age_group of the runner, the finish_net_minutes variable shows the race result time of the runner that is timed from when they cross the starting gate at the beginning of the race to the finish line. The full data (boston_marathon_2023.csv) is available at SCORE Data Repo and contains many more variables associated with the runner information and times.\n\nLoad the following packages: tidyverse, multcomp\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse) |&gt; suppressPackageStartupMessages()\nlibrary(multcomp)|&gt; suppressPackageStartupMessages()\n\n\nLoad the data into R.

If using ggplots, use bins=200 in the options. If using base R’s hist function, use breaks=200. (Note that setting the bins/breaks to be a large number is only feasible because the sample size is so large.)\n\n\n# use\n\nggplot(bos_marathon, aes(x = finish_net_minutes)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 200)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# or\n\nhist(bos_marathon$finish_net_minutes, breaks = 200)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that, while predominately right skewed with a major mode around 220 minutes, there seems to be a clear spike at approximately 175 minutes.

    "text": "Please note that these material have not yet completed the required pedagogical and industry peer-reviews to become a published module on the SCORE Network. However, instructors are still welcome to use these materials if they are so inclined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeague of Legends (LoL) is a 5 v. 5 multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed by Riot Games. In this game, players assume the role of a “champion” with unique abilities and engage in intense battles against a team of other players or computer-controlled champions. Riot Games continually collects data to evaluate the impact of each champion, adjusting and fine-tuning various aspects to ensure fair and competitive gameplay. With regular updates (patches) occurring every two weeks, champions can become either extremely efficient and strong or in need of adjustments to enhance their abilities. Maintaining overall game balance is crucial, and developers employ strategies known as “nerfing” and “buffing” to achieve this balance. “Nerfing” refers to reducing the power or effectiveness of a champion or item, while “buffing” involves increasing its power or effectiveness.\nIn this worksheet, we will analyze and describe histograms of Win Rates for different champions in LoL. The Win Rate, a key metric in the game, represents the percentage of games won by a champion out of the total games played. Understanding the distribution of Win Rates and identifying potential outliers can provide valuable insights into champion balance and performance, informing strategic decision-making in LoL gameplay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of this activity, you will be able to:\n\nUnderstand the concept of histograms and their relevance in statistical analysis.\nAnalyze and describe histograms to gain insights into the distribution of Win Rates in League of Legends. In particular, being able to describe the center, shape, and spread of a distribution based on the displayed graph.\nIdentify potential outliers in a numerical variable using numerical methods such as the “1.5 IQR Rule” or z-scores.\nInterpret the implications of outliers in terms of champion balance and performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology requirement: The activity handout provides histograms and summary statistics so that no statistical software is required. However, the activity could be modified to ask students to produce that information from the raw dataset and/or extend the activity to investigate other variables available in the data.\n\nHistograms: Familiarity with histograms as a graphical representation of the distribution of a continuous variable, such as Win Rates, is crucial. You should understand how to interpret histograms, including the concepts of bins, frequencies, and the shape, center, and spread of distributions.\nOutliers: Knowledge of outliers, which are data points that deviate significantly from the overall pattern, is important.\nFamiliarity with basic statistical analysis techniques, such as measures of central tendency (mean, median) and measures of dispersion (standard deviation, range), will aid in interpreting and analyzing the histograms. These techniques can provide insights into the overall characteristics and variability of the Win Rates.\nKnowledge of outlier detection methods (such as the 1.5 IQR Rule and/or z-scores) is fundamental to the activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA data frame for 162 champions of the following 7 variables. Each row represents a Champion that you can choose when playing League of Legends during patches 12.22 and 12.23. Note that the activity provided in this module does not use all of the variables provided. Instead they are provided for further analyses at the discretion of the user.\nDownload data: LOL_patch_12.22.csv\nDownload data: LOL_patch_12.23.csv\n\n\nVariable Descriptions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nName\nname of the champion\n\n\nRole\nrole of the champion in a game\n\n\nKDA\nAverage kills, deaths and assists associated with each champion\n\n\nWRate\nwin rates of each champion\n\n\nPickRate\npick rates of each champion\n\n\nRolePerc\npercentage of time playing as a role\n\n\nBanPerc\nban percentages associated with each champion\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLol champion stats, 12.22 master, win rates.

One notable finding from this worksheet is the identification of Sion as a low outlier in the Win Rates for the 12.22 patch. However, in the subsequent 12.23 patch, Sion’s Win Rate improved, and was no longer an outlier. Sion was given a Buff in patch 12.23, resulting in an enhanced performance and a more balanced Win Rate. However, patch 12.23 resulted in two new outliers with low win rates.\nThe continued presence of outliers highlights the importance of continuous monitoring and adjustments by game developers to ensure fair and competitive gameplay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreated by George Charalambous (St. Lawrence University), Ivan Ramler (St. Lawrence University), A.J.

However, instructors are still welcome to use these materials if they are so inclined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeague of Legends (LoL) is a 5 v. 5 multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed by Riot Games. In this game, players assume the role of a “champion” with unique abilities and engage in intense battles against a team of other players or computer-controlled champions. Riot Games continually collects data to evaluate the impact of each champion, adjusting and fine-tuning various aspects to ensure fair and competitive gameplay. With regular updates (patches) occurring every two weeks, champions can become either extremely efficient and strong or in need of adjustments to enhance their abilities. Maintaining overall game balance is crucial, and developers employ strategies known as “nerfing” and “buffing” to achieve this balance. “Nerfing” refers to reducing the power or effectiveness of a champion or item, while “buffing” involves increasing its power or effectiveness.\nIn this worksheet, we will analyze and describe histograms of Win Rates for different champions in LoL. The Win Rate, a key metric in the game, represents the percentage of games won by a champion out of the total games played. Understanding the distribution of Win Rates and identifying potential outliers can provide valuable insights into champion balance and performance, informing strategic decision-making in LoL gameplay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of this activity, you will be able to:\n\nUnderstand the concept of histograms and their relevance in statistical analysis.\nAnalyze and describe histograms to gain insights into the distribution of Win Rates in League of Legends. In particular, being able to describe the center, shape, and spread of a distribution based on the displayed graph.\nIdentify potential outliers in a numerical variable using numerical methods such as the “1.5 IQR Rule” or z-scores.\nInterpret the implications of outliers in terms of champion balance and performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology requirement: The activity handout provides histograms and summary statistics so that no statistical software is required. However, the activity could be modified to ask students to produce that information from the raw dataset and/or extend the activity to investigate other variables available in the data.\n\nHistograms: Familiarity with histograms as a graphical representation of the distribution of a continuous variable, such as Win Rates, is crucial. You should understand how to interpret histograms, including the concepts of bins, frequencies, and the shape, center, and spread of distributions.\nOutliers: Knowledge of outliers, which are data points that deviate significantly from the overall pattern, is important.\nFamiliarity with basic statistical analysis techniques, such as measures of central tendency (mean, median) and measures of dispersion (standard deviation, range), will aid in interpreting and analyzing the histograms. These techniques can provide insights into the overall characteristics and variability of the Win Rates.\nKnowledge of outlier detection methods (such as the 1.5 IQR Rule and/or z-scores) is fundamental to the activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA data frame for 162 champions of the following 7 variables. Each row represents a Champion that you can choose when playing League of Legends during patches 12.22 and 12.23. Note that the activity provided in this module does not use all of the variables provided. Instead they are provided for further analyses at the discretion of the user.\nDownload data: LOL_patch_12.22.csv\nDownload data: LOL_patch_12.23.csv\n\n\nVariable Descriptions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nName\nname of the champion\n\n\nRole\nrole of the champion in a game\n\n\nKDA\nAverage kills, deaths and assists associated with each champion\n\n\nWRate\nwin rates of each champion\n\n\nPickRate\npick rates of each champion\n\n\nRolePerc\npercentage of time playing as a role\n\n\nBanPerc\nban percentages associated with each champion\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLol champion stats, 12.22 master, win rates.

One notable finding from this worksheet is the identification of Sion as a low outlier in the Win Rates for the 12.22 patch. However, in the subsequent 12.23 patch, Sion’s Win Rate improved, and was no longer an outlier. Sion was given a Buff in patch 12.23, resulting in an enhanced performance and a more balanced Win Rate. However, patch 12.23 resulted in two new outliers with low win rates.\nThe continued presence of outliers highlights the importance of continuous monitoring and adjustments by game developers to ensure fair and competitive gameplay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreated by George Charalambous (St. Lawrence University), Ivan Ramler (St. Lawrence University), A.J.
