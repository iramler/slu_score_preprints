However, instructors are still welcome to use these materials if they are so inclined.\n\n\nIn NASCAR, driver rating is a metric used to evaluate the performance of drivers in races. It provides a comprehensive assessment of a driver’s overall competitiveness, efficiency, and consistency during a race. The driver rating is based on several key performance factors and is designed to offer a more objective view of a driver’s abilities. For this activity, you will be exploring the relationship between average position a driver finishes per lap over a season and their corresponding driver rating. Using data transformations techniques and polynomial regression to create different variations of linear models, you will enhance the capabilities of your models to make them more effective and accurate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of the activity, you will have practiced: * Assessing simple linear regression model effectiveness * Checking regression model assumptions * Using log transformations to better fit a linear regression model * Using polynomial regression to fit a curved relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this activity, students will need to use software to create scatterplots and plots of residual vs fitted values of models they will create. They will also need to create polynomial models and mutate the data by applying mathematic functions to columns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data comes from the NASCAR website and shows the season statistics from 2007-2022.

Through the transformation of the average position variable, the worksheet enables students to enhance linearity in their models, thereby improving the accuracy of their predictions and analysis. The identification of curvature in the variable relationship also allows for the model using quadratic regression to be highly effective. The model can be conceptually compared to the model using a square root transformation to capture the same curve. Assessing the effectiveness of each model, students can critically evaluate the different approaches and determine the most suitable model for the data. This exercise equips students with essential data transformation and modeling skills, empowering them to make informed decisions and gain a deeper understanding of the factors influencing a driver’s performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFill in later"
