    "text": "Please note that these material have not yet completed the required pedagogical and industry peer-reviews to become a published module on the SCORE Network. However, instructors are still welcome to use these materials if they are so inclined.\n\n\nData for a particular sport is often stored across numerous locations. For example, in NCAA Division I Softball, batting statistics for each season are typically stored in separate tables. (See for example the statistics hosted by https://d1softball.com/.)\nSuppose we are interested in tracking the statistics of players across multiple seasons. A common way to prep the data to do this is to use join statements to merge each seasons data into one table with one row per player (and columns associated with their different statistics for each season).\nThis module looks at some simple batting stats over two seasons through the use of joining functions for a small subset of NCAA Division 1 Softball players’ statistics for the 2021 and 2022 seasons. (This is only a small window of a much bigger dataset).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\n\n\n\nUpon completion of this module students should improve upon\n\nbeing able to join two data tables\nbeing able to anticipate (by sketching) the resulting data table prior to running the code to do so\nidentify situations where more than one key is needed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n\n\n\n\n\nFor R users, recall that six commonly used joining functions available through the dplyr package are, left, right, full, inner, semi, and anti. Additionally, other useful dplyr verbs for combining multiple tables of data include intersect, union, and setdiff. (These are called set operators. )\nFurther details regarding joins can be found at https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/two-table.html.\nTechnology requirement: The activity handout has optional components for students that can use technology to perform the joins. However, it is not a requirement to complete the main exercises. It is assumed that students will use R for the module, but a pair of databases (one in sqlite, the other in duckdb) are provided for students that prefer to use SQL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are four data tables associated with this module.\nTwo of them, batting2021 and batting2022, contain statistics for all Division 1 Softball player who played in the 2021 and/or 2022 season.\nThe other two, batting2021_subset and batting2022_subset, represent non-random samples taken the full data.

A common way to prep the data to do this is to use join statements to merge each seasons data into one table with one row per player (and columns associated with their different statistics for each season).\nThis module looks at some simple batting stats over two seasons through the use of joining functions for a small subset of NCAA Division 1 Softball players’ statistics for the 2021 and 2022 seasons. (This is only a small window of a much bigger dataset).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\n\n\n\nUpon completion of this module students should improve upon\n\nbeing able to join two data tables\nbeing able to anticipate (by sketching) the resulting data table prior to running the code to do so\nidentify situations where more than one key is needed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n\n\n\n\n\nFor R users, recall that six commonly used joining functions available through the dplyr package are, left, right, full, inner, semi, and anti. Additionally, other useful dplyr verbs for combining multiple tables of data include intersect, union, and setdiff. (These are called set operators. )\nFurther details regarding joins can be found at https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/two-table.html.\nTechnology requirement: The activity handout has optional components for students that can use technology to perform the joins. However, it is not a requirement to complete the main exercises. It is assumed that students will use R for the module, but a pair of databases (one in sqlite, the other in duckdb) are provided for students that prefer to use SQL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are four data tables associated with this module.\nTwo of them, batting2021 and batting2022, contain statistics for all Division 1 Softball player who played in the 2021 and/or 2022 season.\nThe other two, batting2021_subset and batting2022_subset, represent non-random samples taken the full data. These are displayed below. R is the number of runs scored by the player, H is the number of hits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbatting2021_subset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayer\nTeam\nR\nH\n\n\n\n\nAaliyah Swan\nCal State Northridge\n8\n20\n\n\nAbbey Latham\nOle Miss\n25\n53\n\n\nBella Rocco\nBoise State\n16\n42\n\n\nCarson Fischer\nNorthern Colorado\n11\n15\n\n\nDrew Dudley\nAustin Peay\n10\n29\n\n\nEmily Gant\nBoston University\n31\n36\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbatting2022_subset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayer\nTeam\nR\nH\n\n\n\n\nAaliyah Swan\nCal State Northridge\n16\n23\n\n\nAbbey Latham\nOle Miss\n36\n45\n\n\nBella Rocco\nBoise State\n10\n29\n\n\nEmily Gant\nBoston University\n40\n55\n\n\nLexi Osowski\nAustin Peay\n42\n64\n\n\nMikayla Allee\nOle Miss\n36\n28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional details for the full data (batting2021 and batting2022)\n\nThe 2021 data set has 2131 rows with 22 columns.

However, instructors are still welcome to use these materials if they are so inclined.\n\n\nProfessional Bull Riding (PBR) is a sport that requires a unique combination of skill, strength, and courage. Riders must stay on a bucking bull as long as they can, using only one hand to hold on while the bull tries to throw them off. The rider is scored based on their performance, and the bull is also scored based on how well it bucks. In this dataset, we will explore the data from the 2023 season of the PBR league, Touring Pro Division, to understand the factors that contribute to a rider’s success and the performance, and the same for the bulls.\n\nIn these worksheets, we will exploring models that predict the points earned by riders and bulls in the 2023 season of the Professional Bull Riding (PBR) league, Touring Pro Division. We will fit multiple linear regression models to predict rider points and logistic regression models to predict bull points. We will interpret the model summary outputs, analyze patterns and trends, identify potential outliers, and test model efficiency.\n\nPreliminary script for video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of this activity, you will be able to:\n\nUnderstand how to fit and interpret multiple linear models along with logistic regression models.\nAnalyze and describe model summary outputs, as well as explaining patterns or trends, and effects of multicollinearity\nIdentify potential outliers from residual plots, and using variable transformation to improve model.\nAbility to test model efficiency, as well as performing nested-hypothesis test to find best model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology requirement: The activity handout will require R-studio to complete the questions.

This will require familiarity with the lm() and glm() functions.\nModel Summary: Understand how to analyze and describe the patterns or trends in the data, along with how to identify the presence multicollinearity and how to fix it in the model.\nOutliers: Know how to properly deal with outliers, data points that impact the overall trend/pattern of data, along with the rules of cooks distance. This will will involve the analysis of the residual plots of the models using plot() function.\nHypothesis Testing: Understand how to perform nested-hypothesis test to find the best model, along with the rules testing. This will require the use of the anova() function, or can be completed by hand with use of summary outputs, along with anova tables of individual models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA data frame for 38 riders from the 2023 season of the Professional Bull Riding (PBR) league, for the Touring Pro Division.

Riders must stay on a bucking bull as long as they can, using only one hand to hold on while the bull tries to throw them off. The rider is scored based on their performance, and the bull is also scored based on how well it bucks. In this dataset, we will explore the data from the 2023 season of the PBR league, Touring Pro Division, to understand the factors that contribute to a rider’s success and the performance, and the same for the bulls.\n\nIn these worksheets, we will exploring models that predict the points earned by riders and bulls in the 2023 season of the Professional Bull Riding (PBR) league, Touring Pro Division. We will fit multiple linear regression models to predict rider points and logistic regression models to predict bull points. We will interpret the model summary outputs, analyze patterns and trends, identify potential outliers, and test model efficiency.\n\nPreliminary script for video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of this activity, you will be able to:\n\nUnderstand how to fit and interpret multiple linear models along with logistic regression models.\nAnalyze and describe model summary outputs, as well as explaining patterns or trends, and effects of multicollinearity\nIdentify potential outliers from residual plots, and using variable transformation to improve model.\nAbility to test model efficiency, as well as performing nested-hypothesis test to find best model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology requirement: The activity handout will require R-studio to complete the questions. This will need to be able to have access to both CSV files.\n\nModel Fitting: Know how to fit multiple linear regression and logistic regression model in R, along with interpreting the model summary output. This will require familiarity with the lm() and glm() functions.\nModel Summary: Understand how to analyze and describe the patterns or trends in the data, along with how to identify the presence multicollinearity and how to fix it in the model.\nOutliers: Know how to properly deal with outliers, data points that impact the overall trend/pattern of data, along with the rules of cooks distance. This will will involve the analysis of the residual plots of the models using plot() function.\nHypothesis Testing: Understand how to perform nested-hypothesis test to find the best model, along with the rules testing. This will require the use of the anova() function, or can be completed by hand with use of summary outputs, along with anova tables of individual models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA data frame for 38 riders from the 2023 season of the Professional Bull Riding (PBR) league, for the Touring Pro Division.

In this game, players assume the role of a “champion” with unique abilities and engage in intense battles against a team of other players or computer-controlled champions. Riot Games continually collects data to evaluate the impact of each champion, adjusting and fine-tuning various aspects to ensure fair and competitive gameplay. With regular updates (patches) occurring every two weeks, champions can become either extremely efficient and strong or in need of adjustments to enhance their abilities. Maintaining overall game balance is crucial, and developers employ strategies known as “nerfing” and “buffing” to achieve this balance. “Nerfing” refers to reducing the power or effectiveness of a champion or item, while “buffing” involves increasing its power or effectiveness.\nIn this worksheet, we will analyze and describe histograms of Win Rates for different champions in LoL.

One notable finding from this worksheet is the identification of Sion as a low outlier in the Win Rates for the 12.22 patch. However, in the subsequent 12.23 patch, Sion’s Win Rate improved, and was no longer an outlier. Sion was given a Buff in patch 12.23, resulting in an enhanced performance and a more balanced Win Rate. However, patch 12.23 resulted in two new outliers with low win rates.\nThe continued presence of outliers highlights the importance of continuous monitoring and adjustments by game developers to ensure fair and competitive gameplay."

However, instructors are still welcome to use these materials if they are so inclined.\n\n\nFormula 1 (F1) Racing is the highest class of single-seater auto racing sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA). Each year, an F1 season features a series of races, known as Grand Prix, which are held in a variety of countries and circuit types. Each of these circuits have their own characteristic’s that make the race unique, ranging from overall track layout and location, to specific corners and race-day weather conditions. Each season, teams and drivers compete for the World Constructors’ Championship and the World Drivers’ Championship, respectively. For the full history and more information about the sport, visit F1’s Wikipedia page here or their website here.\nAt the time of racing, the 2023 Miami Grand Prix was only the 11th time in F1’s history where all cars that started the race crossed the finish line. This meant that there were no crashes, mechanical failures, or race-ending driver mistakes. In addition, there were also no yellow or red flags issued to indicate an incident on or off the track ahead. In addition, there were no safety cars deployed that could slow or bring the field together.\nIn this worksheet, we will analyze and describe histograms of lap times for Max Verstappen for the 2023 F1 Miami Grand Prix. Lap times over the course of a race are determined by a multitude of factors, including tire softness (usually a change in tenths of a second) or pit stops (a change in time by upwards of 15 seconds). Understanding the distribution of lap times over the course of a race and identifying potential outliers can provide valuable insights into the consistency and performance of a driver.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of this activity, you will be able to:\n\nUnderstand the concept of histograms and their relevance in statistical analysis.\nIdentify potential outliers in a numerical variable using numerical methods such as the “1.5 IQR Rule”.\nUnderstand outliers and their effect on the data/summary statistics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology requirement: The activity handout provides histograms and summary statistics so that no statistical software is required. However, the activity could be modified to ask students to produce that information from the raw dataset and/or extend the activity to investigate other variables available in the data.\n\nHistograms: Familiarity with histograms as a graphical representation of a numerical variable (like lap times) is crucial. Students should understand how to interpret histograms, using shape, center, and spread of distributions.\nOutliers: Knowledge of outliers is important.\nFamiliarity with basic statistical analysis techniques, such as measures of central tendency (mean, median) and measures of dispersion (standard deviation, range), will aid in interpreting and analyzing the histograms.\nKnowledge of outlier detection methods (such as the 1.5 IQR Rule) is needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data set contains 1138 rows and 7 columns. Each row represents a single lap by a driver who competed in the 2023 F1 Miami Grand Prix. It is important to note that Oscar Piastri and Logan Sargeant were each lapped once, meaning that they each have 56 rows of lap data, rather than the 57 of the other 18 drivers.\nDownload data used: miami2023_data.csv\n\n\nVariable Descriptions\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ndriverId\nUnique identifier for each driver\n\n\ndriverName\nThe full name of the driver\n\n\nconstructorId\nUnique identifier for each constructor\n\n\nconstructorName\nCommonly used name of each constructor\n\n\nlap\nThe lap number\n\n\nlapTime\nThe time taken to complete the lap, in seconds\n\n\nlapPosition\nThe position of the driver at the end of the lap\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula 1 World Championship (1950 - 2023)\n\n\n\n\nClass handout\nClass handout with sample solutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, the analysis of lap time histograms in F1 races have provided valuable insights into the variation of lap times across a single Grand Prix.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Welcome video\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nFor this activity, you will be exploring the result times from female and male runners that finished the 2023 Boston Marathon.\nIn particular, you will examine both visualizations and summary statistics of result times to explore the variation in finish times as well as use comparative techniques, such as z-scores, to compare and contrast male and female participants.\nInvestigating these trends is useful for several reasons. Firstly, exploring these trends can help to deepen our understanding of how different factors, such as gender, impact marathon performances. Secondly, analyzing the distribution of finish times and the performance of top finishers against the masses provides insights into the competitive landscape of the marathon. It can identify outliers or exceptional performances and understand how elite athletes compare to average participants. Although not directly connected to this data, analyses like these can inform training strategies, highlight the effectiveness of different preparation methods, and inspire both new and experienced runners by showcasing the range of achievable performances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity Length\n\n\n\n\n\nThis activity would be suitable for an in-class example or quiz.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of the activity, you will be able to:\n\nAnalyze distributions using histograms\nIdentify potential confounding variables to explain bimodal data\nCompare and contrast distributions for a pair of groups\nCalculate and compare z-scores for individual cases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this activity, students will primarily use basic concepts of histograms and summary statistics to analyze distributions. Students will also likely require knowledge of z-scores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology Requiremens\n\n\n\n\n\nThe provided worksheets do not require any specific statistical software. (Although they will likely require access to a calculator.)\nSince the data are provided, instructors are encouraged to modify the worksheets to have student construct visualizations and calculate summary statistics using whichever software they choose.\n\n\n\n\n\nData\nThe data set contains 26598 rows and 15 columns. Each row represents a runner who completed the Boston Marathon in 2023\nDownload data:\nAvailable on the SCORE Data Repository: boston_marathon_2023.csv\n\n\nVariable Descriptions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nage_group\nage group of the runner\n\n\nplace_overall\nfinishing place of the runner out of all runners\n\n\nplace_gender\nfinishing place of runner among the same gender\n\n\nplace_division\nfinishing place of runner among runners of the same gender and age group\n\n\nname\nname of runner\n\n\ngender\ngender of runner\n\n\nteam\nteam the runner is affiliated with\n\n\nbib_number\nbib number of runner\n\n\nhalf_time\nhalf marathon time of runner\n\n\nfinish_net\nfinishing time timed from when they cross the starting gate\n\n\nfinish_gun\nfinishing time of runner timed from when the starter gun is fired\n\n\nhalf_time_sec\nhalf marathon time in seconds\n\n\nfinish_net_sec\nnet finish in seconds\n\n\nfinish_gun_sec\ngun finish in seconds\n\n\nfinish_net_minutes\nnet finish in minutes\n\n\n\nData Source\nBoston Athletic Association\n\n\n\nMaterials\nWe provide editable MS Word handouts along with their solutions.\nClass handout\nClass handout - with solutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, the Boston Marathon Times worksheet provides valuable learning opportunities for students in several key areas. It allows them to understand reasons by variability might exist and to discover multimodal distributions can occur simply due to excluding an important explanatory variable that otherwise confounds the analysis. The calculation of z-scores or other similar measurement of relative location enables students to compare and contrast the remarkable achievements of the top female and male finishers, shedding light on their talent in their respective fields. Overall, this worksheet allows students to critically analyze the 2023 marathon result data and draw meaningful conclusions about the extraordinary performances of athletes in the race.",

The hypothesis test for the slope term of Bike Time yielded a p-value of 0, indicating its significance. Additionally, the 95% confidence interval for the slope term of Swim Time excluded 0, further affirming its significance.\nHowever, when both Swim Times and Bike Times were included as predictors in the multiple linear regression model, we observed a change in significance. Swim Times were no longer a significant predictor. This finding suggests that when considering both predictors simultaneously, the predictive power of Swim Times in estimating run times diminishes. These findings emphasize the importance of evaluating multiple predictors in regression analysis and understanding how their inclusion can impact the significance and interpretation of individual predictors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFill in later",
