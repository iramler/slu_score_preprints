This page contains education materials for the [SCORE Network](https://scorenetwork.org/index.html) that were created by faculty and students from the [Department of Mathematics, Computer Science, and Statistics at St. Lawrence University](https://www.stlawu.edu/offices/math-computer-science-and-statistics){target="_blank"}.

The [SCORE Network](https://scorenetwork.org/index.html) Module Repository enables you to search for modules by either sport (along the left), or you can browse [by statistics and data science topic](by-statsds-topic.qmd).

Please note that these material have not yet completed the required pedagogical and industry peer-reviews to become a published module on the SCORE Network. However, instructors are still welcome to use these materials if they are so inclined.

_The development of the SCORE with Data network is funded by the National Science Foundation (award 2142705)._
